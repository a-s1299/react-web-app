# react-web-app, an "Internet Software" capstone project
> This web application was developed as a course capstone project requirement for my final elective course. 
> Being formally introducted to React and its capabilities for the first time, I was excited to flesh out a fully functional webapp with modular support for any future projects I may have. Previous experiences with backend development proved useful in designing the functionality of the frontend. This made the prioritization of data and control flow much easier to handle.
## Description
> The project was to develop a full-stack application utilizing modern software development techonologies in order to track library books. This was accomplished by using the MERN stack: Mongo DB, Express, React, and NodeJS.
## Future
> Further improvements could abstract API calls on the frontend, as well as more securely handle database credentials on the backend (those of which have been removed for security purposes).
> Below are screenshot images of the final product. Future updates to this repository will likely include the application in working order using github-pages.
